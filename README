 How to create a new panel
===========================


Basics
======

At least two files are needed to create a new panel. A qml file which
contains the panel implementation and a .panel file which contains
basic information of the panel.

Here is an example of .panel file::

  [Panel]
  DisplayName=Example
  DisplayName[fi]=Esimerkki
  DefaultIndex=6
  UniqueName=example
  Path=/usr/share/meego-ux-panels/example/examplepanel.qml

Panels are based on FlipPanel which is found in MeeGo.Panels 0.1
package. FlipPanel contains basic integration to panels and the two
sides (front and back) for panel specific content items.

Here is an example of quite minimal panel with empty front side and
standard back side without any settings::

  import Qt 4.7
  import MeeGo.Panels 0.1

  FlipPanel {
      id: container

      front: Panel {
          id: testPanel
          panelTitle: qsTr("Test")
      }

      back: BackPanelStandard {
          panelTitle: qsTr("Test settings")
          subheaderText: qsTr("Test panel content")

          onClearHistClicked:{
             console.log("Clear history clicked!");
          }
      }
  }

Content visual components
=========================

There are several components that can be used to maintain consistent
look.

SimplePanel and Panel
---------------------

SimplePanel and Panel provide basic panel look: header (property
panelTitle) and content area with proper backgrounds.

Front side header background is::

  image://themedimage/widgets/apps/panels/panel-header-<panel-unique-name>

where <panel-unique-name> can be set in .panel file (UniqueName). If
unique name is not set in .panel file it is then set to the basename
of of the .panel (e.g. if you have mypanel.panel then unique name is
mypanel).

PanelExpandableContent
----------------------

PanelExpandableContent is the basic component for a block of content
in Panel or SimplePanel. It contains an optional header (property
text) and a content component (property contents). Header can be
hidden by settings showHeader property to false. Width of
PanelExpandableContent.contents is set by PanelExpandableContent while
height is determined by contents.

Tiles
-----

Panel content is organized in three kind of tiles: primary tiles,
secondary tiles and list items. Each of these has matching component
available: PrimaryTile, SecondaryTile / SecondaryTileBase /
SecondaryTileGridItem and TileListItem. Primary tiles should be put
inside PrimaryTileGrid while secondary tiles can be in list style
(SecondaryTile and SecondaryTileBase) or in a SecondaryTileGrid. List
items will naturally be put in list. All tile items are base on
TileItem that provides support of standard interaction by forwarding
signals pressAndHold and clicked from internal MouseArea and a
separator (property separatorVisible) when tile is part of a list.
